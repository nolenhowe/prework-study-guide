# Prework Study Guide Page

## Description

- I created an easy to use study guide website for bootcamp students
- This allows me to have a single solution to easily keep track of and store my notes
- I learned how to code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript while creating the
study guide website and how they all work together

## Installation

- N/A

## Usage

- To alter this study guide: launch the HTML file and add notes as needed to the <ul> sections under each respective study topic. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
